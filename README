This repo contains the lift Project templates for SBT 0.10.1 

These templates take the source folder from the Lift project's original SBT templates. 

I have just put the appropriate SBT 0.10.1 build files and added a few plugins to the project/plugins/build.sbt

The plugins are -

- xsbt To support "jetty-run" in SBT 0.10.1

- netbeans To generate a netbeans project if you use that IDE

- eclipse To generate a eclipse project iff you use that IDE


From the Lift project's Repo an explanation of what these projects have,

- lift_basic is a basic Lift application with a built-in user class
             and nice use of Blueprint CSS and HTML5

- lift_blank is a blank Lift project that does not have any model
             or CSS

- lift_basic_mongo is a same as basic Lift application using MongoDB instead of
             the embedded H2 DB. We use a custom ProtoUser as there is a bug in the
             PasswordField implementation of Lift Mongo.


Along with these I have also added a SBT folder which has sbt-launcher.jar and sbt shell script for SBT 0.10.1
